While exploring creative design outside of computer science, I independently conceptualized and created a custom pillow featuring original artwork. The process included choosing materials, designing the pattern, and executing the final product by hand. What began as a personal design experiment ultimately led to an opportunity to be published as an artist, with my work featured in https://pupuaoewa.edublogs.org/2022/12/13/three-generations/.
Through this project, I gained experience in: Concept development from idea to final product Textile and visual design Professional presentation and public exposure of original work. This endeavor helped shape my confidence in project ownership and broadened my approach to creativityâ€”skills that now inform how I tackle design and problem-solving in software development.
