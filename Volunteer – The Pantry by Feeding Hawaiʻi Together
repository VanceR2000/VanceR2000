As a volunteer at The Pantry By Feeding Hawaiʻi Together, Hawaiʻi’s only 501(c)(3) e-commerce food distribution site, I support both day-to-day operations and behind-the-scenes infrastructure that helps serve hundreds of families across Oʻahu each week. My contributions span two key areas:

Logistics & Distribution
  Assist with inventory, order fulfillment, and packing to ensure smooth, respectful food distribution
  Collaborate with team members to meet the needs of diverse clients
  Gain hands-on experience with real-world logistics and community-based solutions

Technical Support & Infrastructure
  Provide on-site tech support, troubleshooting computer issues for staff and volunteers
  Reorganized and rerouted wiring within a new server cabinet to improve airflow and cable management
  Assist with general IT maintenance, helping ensure the technology that powers the organization runs smoothly

This role has deepened my understanding of how technology can support nonprofit efficiency, while reinforcing my passion for using my computer science training to serve the community.
