## Hi there 👋

## I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, with an expected graduation date of May 2026, and applying for a Masters degree in Library Science. My studies focus on algorithm design, software development, and data structures. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through code and am particularly interested in areas such as systems programming, simulation, and user-centered software design. I am actively building a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied computer science, and I look forward to contributing to innovative projects in the tech industry.

## Interests:
 ## 1. I enjoy watching movies and playing video games.
 ## 2. Reading is my all time favorite time passer.
 ## 3. Building Lego with or without the instructions.
